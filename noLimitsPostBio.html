            <p>Biotechnology has been defined in many ways but is essentially the application of biological systems to the manufacturing industries. By implication, therefore, food biotechnology is the application of technology to modify genes of animals, plants, and microorganisms to create new species which have desired production, marketing, or nutrition-related properties.</p>

            <p>Before start thinking about how biotech has influenced in our lives is important to settle down what is the main difference between genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and genetically engineered (GE) food. Both terms are used by many of us as synonyms, however, is critical to know that these terms are not. A GMO is a plant, animal, microorganism or another organism whose genetic makeup has been modified in a laboratory using genetic engineering.  On the other hand, genetically engineered (GE) foods refer to foods for which DNA has been altered by human manipulation, often by inserting genes from unrelated species, to introduce new, desirable traits to that organism.</p>

            <p>Biotechnology is nothing new, people have been modifying natural systems to make and alter products for thousands of years, for example in areas as diverse as the brewing of vinegar and alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, in the last century has appeared a current term that is the biosecurity because the development of new tools for improving productivity was being used for worse by some scientists who did not have professional ethics. Along with this, society began to question the risks of consuming products that had been modified genetically. When this happened the government decided to take action and created laws which monitoring the safe use of biotechnological processes.</p>

            <p>It's a shame that people keep a wrong idea of GMOs and GE foods in spite of living in the digital age where with just a "click" you can reach accurate information.</p>
